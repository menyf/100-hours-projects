# 100-Hour Projects
## Origin
What we can do with 100h in 100 days? I have a lot of ideas to explore, some are related to my work, some are meant to make myself cooler. I always stop at the end of the first hour.

This repository is designed to make some records of my progress. All projects should be **time-oriented** at the beginning. Later I may add other **task-oriented** projects. Some projects may take every other day.

I will spent **2 hours** on average each day and make the records here. During these time, I should switch my phone to airplane mode and try to meet the flow. For all the projects, there should be clear goal.
