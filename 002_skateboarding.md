# Project 2: Skateboarding

1. Watch YouTube videos
2. Play and practice outside except for rainy days.

## Day 1 - 04/14/2020

Play alone in the parking lot of apartment for 1h20min.

Total time: 1h20min.

## Day 2 - 04/15/2020

Play alone in the parking lot of apartment for 1h.

Total time: 1h20min + 1h = 2h20min.

## Day 3 - 04/17/2020

Play alone in the parking lot of apartment for 1h10min.

Total time: 2h20min + 1h10min = 3h30min.

## Day 4 - 04/18/2020

Play alone in the parking lot of apartment for 1h. Today I made a breakthrough--I can do Tic tac now.

Total time = 3h30min + 1h = 4h30min.
