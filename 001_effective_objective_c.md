# Project 1: Read *Effective Objective C 2.0*

1. Review what I learnt in the previous day.
2. Complete at lease one item each day.
3. If there is not enough time for a new item, I should try to reproduce what I thought.

## Day 1 - 04/14/2020

Read item 6, 7.

Total time: 1h.

## Day 2 - 04/15/2020

Item 8.

Total time = 1h + 1h = 2h.

## Day 3 - 04/16/2020

Item 9, 10.

Total time = 2h + 1h = 3h. 

Note: this study happens during my work time, so I have stronger motivation on this.

Item 11, 12, 13, 14.

Total time = 3h + 1h = 4h.
